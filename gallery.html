        <h2>Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal loses vote of confidence in Parliament — Who will be the new PM?</h2>
        <p>Nepal’s prime minister lost a vote of confidence in parliament on Friday after the largest party in his coalition government withdrew its support, which would now force him to step down from office after 19 months in power.

            Pushpa Kamal Dahal failed to get the support of more than half the members of the House of Representatives, the lower house of parliament, on Friday which was required to win the vote.
            
            He had to move a confidence motion in parliament after his main ally in government, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) decided to pull out their support last week and join hands with the Nepali Congress — the largest party in the country — to form a new alliance.</p>

        <h2>Delhi excise policy case: Supreme Court grants interim bail to Arvind Kejriwal</h2>
        <p>Supreme Court grants interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister and AAP National Convener Arvind Kejriwal in the Delhi excise policy case on Friday.

            The Apex Court refers his petition challenging his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to a larger bench.
            
            The Supreme Court, while granting interim bail to Kejriwal in the ED case, observed that Arvind Kejriwal has been incarcerated for 90 days, and it is conscious that he is an elected leader.

            CM Kejriwal's lawyer Rishikesh Kumar said, “The Supreme Court has granted him interim bail and the issue of section 19 and necessity of arrest has been referred to a larger bench. CM Kejriwal will remain in custody as his bail in the CBI case is still pending. This is a big victory.”</p>
